The SLIM (Scalable Low-latency Interactive Messaging) Module is the core
executable package of the SLIM framework. It provides the primary runtime
environment, configuration handling, and service orchestration capabilities that
power the entire SLIM ecosystem.

## Overview

SLIM is designed as a modular, high-performance messaging framework that
enables:

- Fast, low-latency communication between distributed components
- Configurable service architecture through a unified configuration system
- Runtime management of multiple services with efficient resource utilization
- Comprehensive observability and telemetry

This module serves as the main entry point for SLIM applications, orchestrating
the entire lifecycle from startup to graceful shutdown.

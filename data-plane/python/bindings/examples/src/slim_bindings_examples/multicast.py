"""
Multicast example (heavily commented).

Purpose:
  Demonstrates how to:
    * Start / connect a local Slim app
    * Optionally create a multicast session (becoming its moderator)
    * Invite other participants (by their IDs) into the multicast group
    * Receive and display messages
    * Interactively publish messages (moderator only)

Key concepts:
  - Multicast sessions are created with PySessionConfiguration.Multicast and
    reference a 'topic' (channel) PyName.
  - Invites are explicit: the moderator invites each participant after
    creating the session.
  - Participants that did not create the session simply wait for
    listen_for_session() to yield their PySession.

Usage:
  slim-bindings-examples multicast \
      --local org/default/me \
      --remote org/default/chat-topic \
      --invites org/default/peer1 --invites org/default/peer2

Notes:
  * If --invites is omitted, the client runs in passive participant mode.
  * If both remote and invites are supplied, the client acts as session moderator.
